## GraphThink

A better way to connect your knowledge. 

## Current Progress 

- ✅ Sync anki cards to a neo4j graph database. 
- ✅ Explore cards spatially with neo4j's broswer.
- ⏳ Build a GUI to connect cards.
- ⏳ Build a study scheduler based on graph algorithms. Page rank, Dijkstra's, ... 
- ⏳ Build a study scheduler based on subgraph logic. "Study only cards tagged with 'simple harmoic motion' and are connected by 'consequence' connections".

## Ideas 
- 💭 Study game to learn the connections between cards. Show cards and fill in the connections.
- 💭 Finetune on Cypher (graph query language) to explore LLM possibilities.
- 💭 Copy your connection appraoch to a friend's knowlegde graph with LLM finetuned on your connections.
- 💭 GraphThinkHub to view other's knowlegde graphs. Imagine looking through a field winner's connections!

## Future Steps
- 🛠️ Merge the GUI into one app, centered around the graph view. Functionaility to add connections + nodes directly on the visulisation.
- 🛠️ Move away from the anki dependency.
- 🛠️ Dockerize all for deployment.
